# UKF Estimate Quadratic Drag Coefficient

This project is focused on estimating the **Quadratic drag coefficient** of 2D projectile motion using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).

## Structure

- **[Code branch](https://github.com/20030726/UKF-Estimate-Quadratic-drag-coefficient/edit/main/README.md)**: Contains the source code for the UKF implementation.
- **[PPT branch](https://github.com/20030726/UKF-Estimate-Quadratic-drag-coefficient/tree/PPT)**: Contains the project presentation.
