# UKF-Estimate-Quadratic-drag-coefficient

This project implements an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to estimate the quadratic drag coefficient in a 2D projectile motion.

## Project Files
- **PPT File**: Describes the entire process of this project, including the problem definition, solution approach, and results.
- **Code File**: Contains the MATLAB code used for the Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the quadratic drag coefficient.

## Project Overview
The project aims to estimate the quadratic drag coefficient by implementing an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The system models a 2D projectile motion, and the UKF is used to update the state estimates based on observed data.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (version R2023b or later)
